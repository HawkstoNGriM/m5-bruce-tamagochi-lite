# Special thanks
-To Deepseek AI for coding most of this
-To me for fixing (for hours) whatever deepseek generates (I feel like itd be faster if i did it on my own, but anway, thanks Chinese ai) 

# Future updates
- Fix spacing
- Add more colors (visibility reasons)
- Fix heart option not displaying the gotchi bg colors 
- Fix mechanics - make it harder for gotchi to be happy (its too easy now) 
	* Add filth increasing with time (just like hunger) which makes gotchi sad
	* Make sure every time i click "clean" that it actually cleans him fully
	* Make sure every time i click feed it makes him eat fully 
	* But every "pet" option to pet the pet will only increase hapiness for 10%
	* Make it so that if not hungry and if clean and if pet twice(20%) then he is happy - so thats probably around 80% hapiness at least - to display actual happy emotions
